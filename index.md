# Zach Chantara's Software Portfolio


Welcome to my ePortfolio! Below are some of the projects I’ve worked on.

## 🧪 Artifact 1: `collection_tests.cpp`


This is a Google Test suite written in C++ that tests the behavior of a dynamic `std::vector<int>`.  
It includes unit tests for adding, resizing, and error handling.


✅ **Skills demonstrated**:
- Test-driven development
- Google Test framework
- Parameterized and fixture-based testing
