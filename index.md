# Welcome to My Secure Coding ePortfolio

This page highlights two artifacts that demonstrate my full-stack skills in secure software development:

---

## 🔹 Artifact 1: `collection_tests.cpp`  
**Language:** C++  
**Purpose:** A Google Test suite to evaluate dynamic behavior of `std::vector<int>`  
[🔗 View file](./cpp-tests/collection_tests.cpp)

### Why It Matters:
- Demonstrates test-driven development using Google Test
- Covers resizing, error handling, and parameterized tests
- Shows thoughtful test structure and reusable fixtures

---

## 🔹 Artifact 2: `Form1.cs` + `Form1.Designer.cs`  
**Language:** C# (Windows Forms App)  
**Purpose:** A GUI that lets users run C++ test executables and view output  
[🔗 View directory](./TestRunnerUI/)

### Key Features:
- UI filters results by pass/fail
- Live test status updates
- Graceful exception handling
- Clear, readable test output

---

## 📌 Why These Artifacts?
These two pieces show how I integrate testing with usability.  
They represent a complete solution — backend testing + frontend UI — and align with course outcomes like:

- **CO3:** Designing functional and user-friendly tools  
- **CO4:** Using appropriate tools (Google Test, Windows Forms)  
- **CO2 & CO5:** Communicating results clearly and writing secure code

## 🔄 Reflection
> “I learned to write reusable test code and present output clearly to users who may not be technical. This project helped me bridge backend logic with user experience.”
