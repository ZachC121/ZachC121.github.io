  <h2>üìö Artifact 2: Course Planner (C++ Project with AVL Tree and DAG)</h2>
  <p>
    This artifact is a Course Planner application that was developed during my CS260: Data Structures and Algorithms course. The initial version used 
    a basic binary search tree (BST) to store and organize course information. Users could load data from a file, search for specific courses, and view 
    a basic list of courses and their prerequisites. For my capstone enhancement, I significantly improved the application by implementing an AVL Tree, 
    a self-balancing variant of the BST, to ensure faster and more reliable search performance, especially as the dataset grew. I also integrated a Directed 
    Acyclic Graph (DAG) to handle course prerequisite relationships, allowing for topological sorting and cycle detection, which made the planner more functional and realistic.
