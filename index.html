    <h2>🧩 Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio
      has helped me identify and showcase my greatest strengths as an aspiring software engineer.
      This program has shaped my professional goals and values, particularly my focus on writing clean,
      secure, and maintainable code, and has prepared me for real-world challenges in the field of
      computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of my degree, I worked on projects that required extensive use of data structures
      and algorithms, database management, and secure software development. These experiences helped me
      understand how to break down complex problems and create scalable, efficient solutions. One such
      project involved developing a secure login system with SQL injection prevention, which demonstrated
      my ability to incorporate both database management and cybersecurity best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also gained practical experience in collaborating within team environments through group
      assignments and agile-based development exercises. These team experiences helped me learn how to
      communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that
      requirements were met and goals were clearly defined. I developed the ability to write
      documentation, present my work, and provide constructive feedback in collaborative settings, all
      of which are crucial in a software development role.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the program, I worked on software engineering tasks that included designing and
      implementing object-oriented systems, applying version control with Git, and testing for both
      functionality and security. These experiences not only reinforced theoretical knowledge but also
      enhanced my ability to build real-world applications that are functional, safe, and user-focused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artifacts included in this portfolio reflect the breadth of my abilities—from algorithm design
      to database architecture to front-end development. Collectively, they demonstrate my full range of
      computer science competencies and showcase how I can deliver value to a development team. These
      projects go beyond coursework by incorporating real-world enhancements that emphasize initiative
      and problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you explore this portfolio, you'll see how these artifacts work together to tell the story of my
      journey through the Computer Science program and my readiness to enter the field as a capable,
      well-rounded software engineer.

      It highlights key projects I've worked on, showcasing my growth and technical ability developed
      over the course of my degree. Over the past four years, I've gained skills in secure software
      development, object-oriented programming (OOP), agile methodology, and more. These competencies
      are foundational to my career goal of becoming a software engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating a professional portfolio is one of the best ways to visually communicate the value I
      offer to a team. The projects included cover important areas of computer science such as software
      design, algorithms, data structures, and databases. Each project was enhanced beyond its original
      requirements to demonstrate initiative, attention to detail, and mastery of fundamental concepts.
      This portfolio showcases my commitment to writing clean, secure, and maintainable code, while
      also ensuring the software is user-friendly and performs well.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support this portfolio, I have prepared a full <strong>code review</strong> that explains
      these enhancements in detail and demonstrates my approach to writing high-quality, secure, and
      maintainable code.
