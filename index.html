# 👨‍💻 Zach Chantara's Software Portfolio

Welcome to my ePortfolio! This portfolio highlights my skills in software testing, secure coding, and user interface development.

---

## 🧪 Artifact 1: `collection_tests.cpp`

This is a Google Test suite written in C++ that tests the behavior of a dynamic `std::vector<int>`.  
It includes unit tests for adding values, resizing, and handling errors using fixtures and parameterized testing.

✅ **Skills demonstrated**:
- Test-driven development
- Google Test framework
- Parameterized and fixture-based testing

## 🖥️ Artifact 2: `Form1.cs` - TestRunnerUI

This is part of a C# Windows Forms application that runs the compiled test suite above and displays results in a user-friendly interface.

✅ **Skills demonstrated**:
- UI/UX development with Windows Forms
- Real-time status updates
- Output filtering and exception handling

## 🎯 Course Outcomes Met

- **Outcome 2**: Communicated technical information clearly through formatted UI and readable test output  
- **Outcome 3**: Designed and evaluated solutions across backend (C++) and frontend (C#) layers  
- **Outcome 4**: Applied established tools like Google Test and Windows Forms to build a working, complete solution  
- **Outcome 5**: Incorporated error handling and secure coding practices throughout

## 💡 Reflection

While building and enhancing these artifacts, I learned:

- How to break down logic into small, testable parts
- To handle edge cases using test fixtures and parameterized tests
- The importance of making interfaces intuitive and responsive

**Challenges faced**:
- Presenting technical test output in a clean, understandable way for users
- Balancing real-time updates without cluttering the interface

These projects represent my ability to create software that is not only functional but also user-friendly and secure.
