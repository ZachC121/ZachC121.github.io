Welcome to my software development portfolio. This repository showcases two key artifacts demonstrating my ability to write secure, testable code and build intuitive user interfaces.

## 📌 Artifact 1: `collection_tests.cpp`

**Description**:  
A C++ Google Test suite that validates the behavior of a dynamic `std::vector<int>`. The tests cover adding values, resizing behavior, and error handling.

**Why This Was Selected**:
- Demonstrates my skills in **test-driven development**
- Includes **parameterized tests**, reusable fixtures, and intentional failure handling
- Reflects a structured approach to secure, maintainable code

## 📌 Artifact 2: `TestRunnerUI` (C# WinForms App)

**Description**:  
A GUI tool developed in C# using Windows Forms that executes and displays results from test executables, like the one above. It includes filters, status labels, and error handling.

**Why This Was Selected**:
- Demonstrates my **UI/UX design skills**
- Shows how I connect backend testing logic to user-facing functionality
- Enhanced with **live status updates**, **dropdown filtering**, and **formatted output**

## 🎯 Course Outcomes Met

- **Outcome 2**: Communicated technical information clearly through formatted UI and readable test output  
- **Outcome 3**: Designed and evaluated solutions across backend (C++) and frontend (C#) layers  
- **Outcome 4**: Applied established tools like Google Test and Windows Forms to build a working, complete solution  
- **Outcome 5**: Incorporated error handling and secure coding practices throughout

## 💡 Reflection

During this project, I learned:
- How to break down logic into **testable units**
- To **handle edge cases** and structure tests for reuse
- To make interfaces **intuitive** and not overwhelm the user

**Challenges**:
- Making test output clear for non-technical users
- Displaying real-time status updates without clutter

These artifacts reflect my growth in building both functional and user-friendly solutions.
