## Artifact 2: Course Planner (C++ with AVL Tree and DAG)

This artifact is a Course Planner application that was developed during my CS260: Data Structures and Algorithms course. The initial version used a basic binary search tree (BST) to store and organize course information. Users could load data from a file, search for specific courses, and view a basic list of courses and their prerequisites. For my capstone enhancement, I significantly improved the application by implementing an AVL Tree, a self-balancing variant of the BST, to ensure faster and more reliable search performance, especially as the dataset grew. I also integrated a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to handle course prerequisite relationships, allowing for topological sorting and cycle detection, which made the planner more functional and realistic.

I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to take an existing, functional system and significantly enhance it using advanced data structures and algorithmic logic. It represents a clear step in my growth from applying basic programming concepts to building more scalable and modular solutions. These enhancements transformed the project from a simple data retrieval system into a more intelligent, dynamic course planning tool. The DAG, in particular, introduced the ability to view courses in the order they should be taken based on prerequisite structure, a feature that mimics real-world scheduling systems in academic institutions.
