# Zach Chantara's Software Portfolio

Welcome to my ePortfolio! This portfolio highlights my skills in software testing, secure coding, and user interface development.

---

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio was created for my final project in the **CS499 Computer Science Capstone** course. It highlights key projects I've worked on, showcasing my growth and technical ability developed over the course of my degree.

Over the past four years, I've gained skills in:

- Secure software development
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Agile methodology

These competencies are foundational to my career goal of becoming a **software engineer**.

Creating a professional portfolio is one of the best ways to visually communicate the value I offer to a team. The projects included cover software design, algorithms, data structures, and databases. Each project was enhanced beyond its original requirements to demonstrate initiative, attention to detail, and mastery of fundamental concepts.

This portfolio showcases:

- Clean, secure, maintainable code
- User-friendly design
- High-performing software solutions

## Artifact 1: `collection_tests.cpp`

A Google Test suite in C++ that tests a dynamic `std::vector<int>`.  
Includes unit tests for adding values, resizing, and handling errors using fixtures and parameterized testing.

[Summary doc](https://github.com/ZachC121/ZachC121.github.io/blob/main/Word%20doc%20Summary/Enhancement%20One_Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering%20Summary.docx)  
[View `test.cpp`](https://github.com/ZachC121/ZachC121.github.io/blob/main/TestRunnerSuite/TestRunnerSuite/test.cpp)

### Skills Demonstrated

- Test-driven development
- Google Test framework
- Parameterized and fixture-based testing
